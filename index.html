                <h1>How M.S.Dhoni became the heartbeat of every ICT fan?</h1>
                <p>Less than thirty years before that enchanting Saturday night when Ravi Shastri’s voice rang through
                    television sets all over India, when even the spunky and exuberant Indian youth showed more interest
                    in an old-school CRT television at a local chai ki dukaan than the dance-floor at a pub, a
                    pump-operator in Ranchi awaited the birth of his third child. <br>
                <blockquote>'Dhoniiiii finishes off in style. A magnificent strike into the crowd. India lift the World
                    Cup after 28 years. The party's started in the dressing room. And it’s an Indian captain,
                    who’s
                    been absolutely magnificent, in the night of the final'.
                </blockquote><br>
                Any cricket fan worth his salt just read this in Ravi Shastri's most dramatic voice, as Mahendra
                Singh Dhoni enchanted the Wankhede on the night of 2nd April 2011.
